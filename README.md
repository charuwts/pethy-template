### Builds

A "Build" happens whenever new information is pushed to the pethy-data branch of the repository. Pethy.app will pull the latest changes, process the files and generate a new commit to push to the gh-pages branch. With advanced configuration this can be directed to a different branch if we aren't using github pages to deploy the site.
